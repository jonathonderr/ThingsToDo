What can I say - I'm a huge geek for any games :)

This list might or might not be up your alley - either way,
I recommend checking out some of these if you want to pick 
up a new expensive hobby :)! In all honesty, a lot of these 
games have got me through college/highschool in some way or another,
and they were a good way for me to make friends (board games especially)!
At a minimum, this list allows me to share with you one of my 
passions/hobbies that I haven't really shared with you before!

 - Board Games

  These games are the most approachable for anyone to try, so I'll put my 
  favorites at the top here:

   - Coup - A fun quick game for 3-6 people that involves lying to your friends 
    before you eliminate them! Sounds bizarre on paper, is a party game that should
    really only take 15 min per round

   - Codenames - A classic. 4-? players work in 2 teams to deduce tiles on 
   a board based on one word phrases (this description is really bad). This game
   is also really fun.

   - Betrayal at House on The Hill - This is the most DND-like game I've played,
   but is also really fun if you know a lot of people who also love board games.
   It's a complicated game to learn at first, with a ton of corny horror elements,
   but once you get the hang of it, no game is ever the same! 

 - VR Games

  You are going to get a quest 2 at somepoint, yeah? Well, when you do, you
  definitely have to check out these games:

    - Beat Saber - I showed you this when I showed you the quest. This is best
    rhythm game I have ever played, and is really good if you like doing something
    to a good rhythm. It also keeps your reflexes up to speed, which should be 
    great for you ;).

    - Superhot - If you are into action, and want a very interesting fighting game,
    check this out. Heck, check this out even if that doesn't sound interesting! I won't
    say anything else about this, this one is fun if you go in blind.

    - Tetris Effect - I put this one in here mostly as a joke, but I can honestly say
    this is a really fun game (it's tetris, so it has that going for it)! Just know 
    that you will have the phenomena called "tetris effect" definitely affect you.

    (The same might also apply to beat saber, depending on the person)

 - Video Games

   - I included these here because I enjoy them, and I think everybody can as well! All 
   of these games I would recommend anyone play, so check out any of them! If they 
   aren't up your alley, thats totally fine, but if they are, heres what I would
   suggest you check out (also make sure your computer can run them [A Windows PC is usually fine]):

    - Journey - This game is one of my favorites, as it is a great intro for anyone
    interested in video games (this was one of my first games I tried), and it has 
    a really good story! The score is also phenomenal, and has definitely stuck with 
    over the years! If you were to only play one video game in your life, I would suggest
    this one.

    - Portal 2 (Portal not required) - A really fun puzzle game, with a really good story.
    This game is what I used to get my sister interested in games, so it has a win in my book
    Just go into knowing you might be stumped on some of the puzzles!

    - Outer Wilds 
    This is my personal favorite - I don't think I've ever found a game with a story this
    good that has changed my view on life. It has great music (I mean that) and and even 
    cooler world to explore. I won't describe anything else about this game, because it 
    is very much worth it to go in blind. I wouldn't recommend this being the first game you
    play however, since the controls can take some time to get used to, and you can easily get
    disoriented. However, if you are still interesting in games after Journey and Portal 2,
    please check this out!
