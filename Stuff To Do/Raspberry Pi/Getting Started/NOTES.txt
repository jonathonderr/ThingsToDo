Hey! Glad you made it!

  The raspberry pi is basically a computer - that is super portable and can do most
anything (with some limits of course). I've included in the box some components to help
you get started, including the raspberry pi, the breadboard, and some modules that the gpio
part of the rpi can use. You can look up the components by model #, but if you want a reference,
here's what I gave ya.

 - Some m/m pin wires - should be enough to get your breadboard started
 - Some fm/fm pin wires
 - A crystal LED panel - if you remember, you helped me solder some parts to it
 - An ultrasonic range sensor (the component with two speakers) - allows you to detect the distance 
      from a point in front of the sensor
 - Thermometer (the component with the blue block)
 - Number (1-4) selector - sends a signal back through gpio notifying which number was touched
 - 2 Breadboards - For a guide on breadboarding, take a look at the [Introduction Breadboards for Beginners link]
      (or just ignore that link if you already know how)
 - A variety of LEDS - just in case you need them! - They are a variety of colors, so whos to say which colors you got?
 - Some resistors (I'll let you figure out what strength they are). I don't really expect these to be too useful to
      you, but hey you never know. They are all the same strength

  You can use these components for a variety of projects, and there are resources online on how to use them, so
do some googling!


 - Documentation

  I don't really expect you to read through all guides I included here. They are really just there to give you a 
  heads up as to what you MIGHT have to deal with. I included 3 programming guides (Python, Javascript, and NodeJS), 
  just in case you need to dig deep into some code. Also, hey, they are super cool programming languages anyway, and
  totally worth learning! Give it a shot if you feel like it! I also included some diagrams that you can reference, but
  the GPIO diagram [rpi 4 pinout (Useful)] is probably the only useful one.

  Some documentation worth looking for:

    - The majority of the rpi documentation, but especially:
      - The Usage Guide
      - The Remote Access guide - very useful if you don't want to dedicate a keyboard and mouse to your pi
      - Linux - will familarize you with the os. If you use remote access, use the [The Unix Shell] guide I provided
      - Config stuff, if you need it
    - Check out some of the python course to begin with, just so you know what you might be getting yourself into
    - The GPIO pinout diagram - Will come in handy, just make sure you have the orientation correct.

  The raspberry pi came with the OS preinstall (it's on the flash drive on the bottom of the pi), so you don't
  need to reinstall the OS, but you can if you want to!

  Good luck! I hope you find some project worth using the pi for! As always, ask me if you have any questions, and I'll
  drop everything to help you!
