These projects are here just in case you need some ideas.

I haven't tried all of these (I only have one raspberry pi, and minimal time), but after
skimming through them, they should all be doable! Some projects are specified for a
PI 3, 3+ or some other model. Most of the time, since those models all run on the same OS,
you should be fine. If not, thats just where you'll have to get creative ;).

You'll have to learn some programming for some of these projects! Don't worry, it isn't a
lot and the guides will walk you through, but if you have questions, feel free to contact me!
I'm sure I can help figure out at least one problem!

Here are some products I would definitely suggest you try:

 - Pi-hole 
      This basically turns your raspberry pi into an adblocking service. All you need
      to set it up is the raspberry pi and your modem/router software.
      
      NOTE: Some modems aren't compatible with this software due to ISPS restricting you from
      change router based DNS servers. There are some workarounds, as mentioned in the link, but 
      they might not work for new devices connecting to your network

 - Smart Security Camera
      Pretty self explanitory, adds a security camera to your home. The software used
      is open-source, which is good if you are paronoid about goverments 
      and corparations watching you. You'll need to buy some other components, including a 
      camera module, and some wood for woodworking

 - FM Radio Transmitter
      Haven't done this one, but it looked cool, and pretty simple to setup, given you 
      have the right components and software!

 - Homebridge
      This ones a doozy, so don't try it if you haven't done any other projects yet. It took
      me a while to scrape through and understand the code, but what it does is allow you to code
      and create your own smart devices (which you can connect to the iOS' home app). This means that
      with some fancy coding and computer workarounds, you can probably turn any of these other 
      projects into a smart device! Again, its a confusing setup, with not a lot of great 
      documentation, so if you get stuck, contact me!
