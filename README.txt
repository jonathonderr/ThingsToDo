Hey Paul!

For Part 2 of your present (I told you it was coming), I wanted to not 
only give you something, but give you something to do in your spare time
as well! I decided to settle on a Raspberry Pi, as it is essentially 
a mini programmable computer that can be made to do anything (as long
as you know how). I suggest once you finish reading this, you check out
the getting started folder (especially Notes.txt) to figure out how to use it!

I also included some projects that the Raspberry Pi can be used for, but that
list is in no way comprehensive, it is just there to get you going on how 
to use a Pi and is also there to spark new ideas as well! 

While I was at it, I decided to include some other things you can do so you
aren't bored sitting around all day in your lawnchair watch the sun move xD!
If they don't catch your eye, thats totally ok!


 -- How to use this flash drive --
 
 This flash drive is really simple! It contains links or photos of things
 I deemed important. If you see a file title NOTES.txt in any folder, 
 make sure to read that file first before checking out the contents of that folder!
 Other than that, feel free to explore, add, or delete stuff in any way you see fit!
 (I get that I'm defining what a flash-drive is used for, but I digress)

 -- What to do with this flash drive (when you are done with it) -- 
 
 This flash drive is yours! Feel free to do whatever you want with it!
 If you need some suggestions, here are some that came to me!

  You could:

   - Add new stuff, and regift it to someone else - kind of like a chain email
   but people aren't mad to recieve one.
   - Wipe it, and use it as a normal flash drive (don't worry I've saved this 
   data somewhere else, just email me and I'll get it back to you)
   - Wipe it, and burn a USB-bootable operating system onto the drive (super 
   useful for pentesting)
   - Play table football with it! (I think its a good size and weight)
   - And other bizarre uses!

-- Finally --

Thank you for all you did when you decided to teach me how to mix sound! You taught
me how to manage chaos in an environment where something could go wrong at any point,
and honestly that's a very useful life skill to have. You kept me on the edge of my seat
and really gave me something to look foward to! I hope in someway, this gift can do the same.

Catch ya later,
-Jono
